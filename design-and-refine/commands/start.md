# Start Design & Refine

Begin an interactive design session that generates UI variations, collects your feedback, and iterates until you're confident in the result.

## Usage

```
/design-and-refine:start [target]
```

**Arguments:**
- `target` (optional): The component or page to design/redesign. If not provided, you'll be asked.

## What This Does

1. **Interviews you** about requirements, pain points, and style direction
2. **Infers visual styles** from your existing codebase
3. **Generates five distinct variations** in a temporary Design Lab route
4. **Collects your feedback** on what you like about each
5. **Synthesizes a refined version** combining the best elements
6. **Iterates until you're confident** in the final design
7. **Cleans up** all temporary files and produces an implementation plan

## Instructions

When this command is invoked, follow the Design Lab skill workflow exactly. The skill contains:
- The complete interview script
- Framework and styling detection logic
- Visual style inference from the project
- Variant generation guidelines
- Feedback collection and synthesis process
- Cleanup procedures

$ARGUMENTS will contain any target specified by the user.

Begin by running the preflight detection, then start the interview process. Use the host-compatible question flow from the skill for interview steps.
